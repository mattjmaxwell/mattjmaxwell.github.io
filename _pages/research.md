# Genetic Load and its Importance

The past decade has seen a resurgence of scientific eugenics. In 2016,
for example, geneticist Michael Lynch published an article in the
well-respected journal `\emph{Genetics}`{=tex} arguing that human mental
and physical performance is declining at a rate of 1% per generation
(Lynch 2016). This estimate was not based on measurements of physical
and mental performance, but rather on an argument from genetic load:
because medical interventions, such as "surgical procedures,
pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, and physical and psychiatric
therapies" have mitigated the effects of selection on "bad genes," the
incidence of deleterious alleles (genes variants) in the human
population has risen and will continue to rise.

The problem, Lynch argues, lies in the fact that natural selection can
only act on existing variation in a population. This variation, however,
imposes a "cost" on a population. A population is less fit if it
contains fitness variation than if it were made up of only the optimal
phenotype, or set of traits. Suppose, for example, a population made up
of two phenotypes: red and blue. Red is fitter---it produces more
surviving offspring on average---than blue. A population made up
entirely of red individuals will, then, have a higher average fitness
than a mixed population of reds and blues. Moreover, if selection is
relaxed, as Lynch and others argue it has been in humans, this will lead
to a higher proportion of low-fitness individuals in the population.

This cost, known as genetic load, has been deployed in biological
arguments for eugenics since Muller (1950) and its use continues in the
works of pro-eugenics philosophers such as Powell (2015) and Gyngell et
al. (2019). The consequences of genetic load for actual populations are
not as well-understood as these authors imply, however. The concept of
genetic load is conceptually heterogeneous and in need of clarification.
It has given rise to several false predictions and puzzles whose
solutions are, as yet, unclear.

In this project I aim to make clear what genetic load is, what we do and
do not know about it, and criticize its use in arguments for eugenics.

# Outline of Chapters

## The Genetic Load Argument for Eugenics

It is commonly accepted that one cannot argue from solely empirical
premises to a moral conclusion. However, empirical premises are often
key in moral arguments. In the present case, genetic load and its
apparent consequences for populations have convinced some biologists and
philosophers that eugenic measures are necessary to preserve the health
of and prevent the extinction of the human population. While there has
been much attention to the moral premises of eugenic arguments by
philosophers such as Barnes (2016) and Wilson (2017), the empirical
premises have been subject to less scrutiny.

Eugenic arguments are frequently dismissed as racist pseudoscience that
relies on "a prejudiced and incorrect understanding of Mendelian
genetics" (*Eugenics and Scientific Racism*, n.d.). This may be true of
many historical and contemporary eugenic arguments, but the genetic load
argument cannot be easily dismissed on these grounds. The argument's
originator, Hermann Muller (Muller 1950), was an architect of modern
evolutionary theory and outspoken critic of race-based eugenics. The
argument's current defender, Michael Lynch, is a well-regarded and
widely-cited geneticist.

In this chapter I evaluate the empirical work and show that the simple
argument from relaxation of selection to fitness declines is invalid. An
increase in frequency of deleterious alleles does not necessarily
correspond to a decrease in fitness.

## Two Puzzles of Genetic Load

In this chapter I examine two puzzles of genetic load, which continue to
be the topic of debate in biology. The first puzzle is that there exists
any significant amount of genetic diversity in natural populations (see
Crow 2008 for discusion). Because genetic diversity decreases the
fitness of a population, natural selection should act to remove any
fitness-affecting genetic diversity in a population. At
mutation-selection equilibrium, then, the amount of fitness-affecting
genetic diversity should be minimal. However, there does appear to be a
significant degree of fitness-affecting diversity in natural
populations.

A second, and more recent, false prediction, pointed out by Kondrashov
(1995), is that the well-accepted Nearly-Neutral Theory (Ohta 1992)
predicts there are many very small deleterious mutations in the genome
and that these ought to lower expected fitness to a degree that is not
empirically supported. Lesecque et al. (2012), for example, note that
application of this theory to humans predicts that 88% of individuals
should fail to reproduce and each reproducing female would need to have
16 offspring in order to maintain population size.

These puzzles trade on ambiguities in the concept of genetic load. I
explore two recognized kinds of load, lag load and substitution load, as
well as a largely ignored third kind---expected load---identified by
Bruce Wallace (1991). Central to this discussion is Wallace's concept of
"soft," or density-dependent, selection, in which load and
fitness-effects appear to come apart. Discussion of soft selection
contributes to the philosophical literature on forms of selection,
adding to the existing literature on frequency dependent and balancing
selection (discussed in Sober (2024)).

# Genetic Load and Evolution

Large genetic loads are often thought to have significant negative
effects on populations, often suggesting an increased chance of
extinction via "mutational meltdown" (Lynch and Gabriel 1990; Lynch et
al. 1995a, 1995b). Mutational meltdown occurs when some deleterious
mutations become fixed through drift, lowering population fitness, which
leads to the fixation of further deleterious mutations through drift,
and so on, until extinction results. It is too quick, however, to
conclude that genetic load is necessarily a burden on a population.

As Haldane (1937) points out, increased numbers of mutations also allow
for increased probability of "evolutionary rescue," i.e., avoiding
extinction through adaptive evolution. This chapter connects with recent
philosophical work on evolvablility (see [Sterelny et al.]{.nocase}
2007; Brown 2014; Bourrat et al. 2024) and discusses the role of
diversity in a changing environment.

Wallace (1991) further argues that genetic load can be a benefit to a
population through the phenomenon of soft selection, increasing the
population's probability of survival while, in an apparent paradox,
lowering the average fitness of the population. While some have invoked
group selection to explain "altruistic" traits such as these (Sober and
Wilson 1999), Wallace holds that the phenomenon he has identified is not
a case of group selection. This mechanism for the evolution of
altruistic traits may thus avoid biologists' longstanding skepticism
about group selection.

# ZFEL and the Genetic Load Research Project

The search for laws in biology has been widely criticized. Some, such as
Beatty (1995) hold that there are no laws, while others, such as Sober
(1997) hold that there are laws but they are *a priori* and
mathematical, not empirical.

McShea and Brandon (2010), the first a biologist, the second a
philosopher, propose that biology has an empirical first law, akin to
Newton's first law of motion. Like Newton's first law, it aims to give
an account of what happens when no forces are acting. McShea and
Brandon's first law is the zero-force evolutionary law, or ZFEL. In
brief, they claim that in any evolutionary system there is a tendency
for diversity and complexity to increase.

According to McShea and Brandon however, ZFEL is not just a law; it is a
"gestalt shift." ZFEL puts diversity and complexity in the background
while foregrounding selection and constraints on diversity. This means
that diversity and complexity do not, in general, stand in need of
explanation, just as inertial motion in Newtonian mechanics does not
stand in need of explanation. It is this "gestalt shift" which I think
has the most significant consequences for biological theory and stands
most in need of defense.

Where others have concluded that research into the sources of diversity
supports ZFEL as a law, I argue that this same research undermines it as
a gestalt shift. If increases in diversity had not stood in need of
explanation then, in their estimation, there would have been no need to
study load in the ways that were done.
