# The Project and its Importance

It is well-understood that random mutation provides the raw materials for evolution, but less well-understood that random mutation imposes a cost on populations.
By incorporating variation due to mutation, among other sources, the fitness of a population is lower than it would be if it were made up of only the optimal (or several optimal) genotypes; this cost to the population in terms of fitness is known as genetic load.
This cost and its consequences for evolution are important topics in genetics, but are, I argue, conceptually heterogeneous and in need of clarification.
Exploring the concept of genetic load fills a gap in our understanding of evolution by natural selection.
By better understanding genetic load we gain a better understanding of how evolution has proceeded and how it is likely to proceed in the future, especially as we change the environment around us.

@muller_our_1950, in a classic paper, quantified load as the expected number of deleterious mutations in an individual in a population.
More recently, following @kojima_genetic_1970, load has been quantified as the difference between the maximum fitness genotype in a population and the mean fitness of the population.
Given certain assumptions these definitions are equivalent, but little has been done to clarify the connections between them, the circumstances in which one or the other should be used and what is meant by "maximum fitness genotype."
This ambiguity has led to confusion with respect to how the evolutionary consequences of genetic load should be understood.

Understanding the evolutionary consequences of load is important for several reasons.
First, research in genetic load has been driven by two apparent paradoxes, neither of which has a settled answer.
Second, genetic load is thought to have consequences for the evolutionary trajectory of a population, but without a clear definition of load, it is unclear what those consequences are.
Knowing which of several concepts is being deployed will help us understand both the past and future of evolution.
Third, philosophers have argued that there is a natural tendency for diversity and complexity to increase.
A close look at how scientists have researched and talked about genetic load, which is a kind of diversity, may shed light on whether there is such a tendency and what role it ought to play in biological theorizing.
Finally, it has been argued that the human population has a high---and increasing---genetic load.
This has convinced some geneticists that eugenic practices are called for in order to reduce human genetic load.
This alleged "value-neutral" and scientific argument for eugenics is especially dangerous and philosophers of biology need to engage with it.

# Outline of Chapters

## Two Paradoxes of Genetic Load

In the first chapter I examine two "paradoxes" of genetic load, which have been the topic of much debate in biology.
The first follows from the fact that there exists a significant degree of fitness diversity.
Conventional wisdom predicts that, at equilibrium, variation in natural populations ought to be near zero [@crow_maintaining_2008].

A second, and more recent, paradox, raised by @kondrashov_contamination_1995, is that there are likely to be many very small deleterious mutations in the genome and that these ought to lower expected fitness to a degree that is not empirically supported.
The idea is that very slightly deleterious alleles (gene variants) will not be "visible" to natural selection and can "drift"---i.e. increase in frequency due to chance alone---to high frequencies in the population.
@lesecque_resolution_2012, for example, note that application of this theory to humans predicts that 88% of individuals should fail to reproduce and each female would need to have 16 offspring in order to maintain population size; this is obviously not the case.

These puzzles lead to an exploration of the concept of load itself and ambiguities in the definition.
I explore two kinds of load, lag load and substitution load, as well as the phenomenon of "soft," or density dependent, selection, in which the concepts of load and fitness appear to come apart.
Discussion of soft selection contributes to the philosophical literature on forms of selection, adding to frequency dependent and balancing selection (discussed in @Sober_2024).

# Genetic Load and Evolution

Large genetic loads are often thought to have significant negative effects on populations, often suggesting an increased chance of extinction via "mutational meltdown" [@lynch_mutation_1990; @lynch_mutation_1995; @lynch_mutational_1995].
Mutational meltdown occurs when some deleterious mutations become fixed through drift, lowering population fitness, which leads to fixation of additional deleterious mutations through drift, and so on until extinction results.
However, as @haldane_effect_1937 points out, increased numbers of mutations allow for increased probability of "evolutionary rescue," i.e., avoiding extinction through adaptive evolution.
In order to bring clarity to these conflicting implications I draw on the conceptual clarifications made in the previous chapter.

# ZFEL and the Genetic Load Research Project

@mcshea_biologys_2010, the first a biologist, the second a philosopher, propose that biology has a first law, akin to Newton's first law of motion.
Like Newton's first law, it aims to give an account of what happens when no forces are acting.
McShea and Brandon's first law is the zero-force evolutionary law, or ZFEL.
Their general formulation of the law is:

> In any evolutionary system in which there is variation and heredity, there is a tendency for diversity and complexity to increase, one that is always present but may be opposed or augmented by natural selection, other forces, or constraints acting on diversity and complexity.

This law has been criticized by @barrett_puzzles_2012, but arguably the program of research into genetic load from @haldane_effect_1937 to the present assumes ZFEL.
At least in the case of mutational load, this research program assumes that there is a source of variation that is indifferent to the good of the species, and thus it will cause diversity to increase.
This diversity increase leads to a diversity in fitness and thus load.

According to McShea and Brandon however, ZFEL is not just a law; it is a "gestalt shift."
ZFEL puts diversity and complexity in the background while foregrounding selection and constraints on diversity.
This means that diversity and complexity do not, in general, stand in need of explanation, just as inertial motion in Newtonian mechanics does not stand in need of explanation.
It is this "gestalt shift" which I think has the most significant consequences for biological theory and stands most in need of defense.

Where others have concluded that research into the sources of diversity supports ZFEL as a law, I argue that this same research undermines it as a gestalt shift.
If increases in diversity had not stood in need of explanation then, in their estimation, there would have been no need to study load in the ways that were done.
This makes it more akin to Newton's law of gravitation, which (by itself) makes no empirical predictions, than Newton's first law [@smith_closing_2014].

## The Mutational Load Argument for Eugenics

Genetic load and its consequences for populations have convinced several geneticists, most recently @lynch_mutation_2016, that eugenic measures are necessary to preserve the health of and prevent the extinction of the human population.
The basic idea is that because medical interventions, nutrition, and sanitation have improved dramatically in the past two centuries (or more), the effect of selection on "bad genes" has been weakened, and therefore the incidence of "bad genes" has, and will continue to, increase.

These arguments are different from those put forward by the recent "newgenics" movement which are concerned with the well-being of individuals [@savulescu_procreative_2001; @gyngell_moral_2019; @Veit_2021]
Proponents of genetic load arguments are concerned, in the first instance, with the fitness of populations.
Instead, the argument from load is intended to show that there is an evolutionary concern---one grounded in biology rather than ethics and similar to worries about sociobiology and its ethical implicaitons in the 1980s (see @Kitcher_1985_Vaulting).

I show that this simple argument---from relaxation of selection to fitness declines---is invalid.
An increase in frequency of deleterious alleles does not necessarily correspond to a decrease in fitness.
A more sophisticated version of the argument is valid, but fails to present a serious concern.
