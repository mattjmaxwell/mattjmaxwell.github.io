I am currently a PhD Candidate in the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) [Department of Philosophy](https://philosophy.wisc.edu/).
I expect to complete my degree in 2027.

My research is primarily on the philosophy of evolution, focusing on population genetics and genetic diversity.
I have also worked on the philosophy of fitness, causation, and formal and social epistemology.
My disseration is on genetic load---the cost of genetic diversity to the fitness of a population---its implications for the evolutionary trajectory of populations, and the deployment of the concept(s) in biological arguments for eugenics from the 1920s to today.
